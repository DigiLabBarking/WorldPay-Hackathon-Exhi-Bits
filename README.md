WorldPay Hackathon SDK by Exhi-Bits

The '../WorldPayGitHub/Share' folder should always contain an empty '.txt' file with the name of either:
  '1' for £40 Nike Bag
  '2' for £10 Shirt
  '3' for £5 Trousers
  Otherwise it will use a default value of '1'
The main folder is '../WorldPayGitHub/Exhi-Bits/WPTechInnovation-worldpay-within-sdk-3e94763/wrappers/python_2-7'
The folder contains the 2 main python files:
  'Producer.py' has to be the first to run and it will put up one of the items up for sale depending on the file in the '../WorldPayGitHub/Share' folder
  'runConsumer.py' has to be run after and this will pay for the item offerd by the 'Producer.py' script
